    "## Shipping Noise Analysis\n",
    "---\n",
    "This tutorial describes use of the *Pacific Ocean Sound Recordings* archive to examine variation in a major source of noise in the ocean: shipping.  Because the lower frequencies of shipping noise travel farther and are thus more detectable regionally, we can use audio data with a relatively low sample rate to examine it.  For efficiency, this tutorial uses the 2 kHz data archive (decimated from the original 256 kHz recordings).  The derived metric is mean-square sound pressure spectral density in the one-third octave band centered at 63 Hz, an [international standard](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC88045).  This tutorial covers reading and processing of the audio data to produce the metric, and examination of time-series results.  It is based on the methods of a [recent publication](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2021.656566/full) that showed reduction of shipping noise during onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",

This site is not near any major ports, thus it does not experience extremely high levels of shipping noise.  However, offshore shipping lanes pass within approximately 20 km of the recorder, and the noise of shipping is a significant part of the local soundscape."

    "For the low-frequency (2 kHz) data, calibration data are not frequency dependent; a single low-frequency calibration value is used.  Its value depends on time of data collection, as two hydrophones have been deployed sequentially at the same site.  Before 14 June 2017, the calibration value is -168.8 dB re V / uPa (measured at 26 Hz).  After this date the value is -177.9 dB re V / uPa (measured at 250 Hz).\n",

    "\n",
    "There is an important distinction between the deployed hydrophones, relevant to time-series analysis.  The first hydrophone exhibited calibration drift, while the second (deployed 13 June 2017 and currently operational) has not.  This observation is consistent with differences in the technologies of the two instruments.  What it means for this application is that time-series analysis of shipping noise should be constrained to the period of the second hydrophone deployment."

    "Our focal metric is the mean-square sound pressure spectral density, ISO 18405 3.1.3.13, for the one-third octave band centered at 63 Hz (ISO, 2017; Dekeling et al., 2014).  To compute this metric effectively, we must distinguish shipping noise from other signals in the same frequency band.  At this recording site, we have found that other signals (harmonics of blue whale vocalizations, mechanical disturbance of the recorder) can influence the metric (see examples in Figure 3 of [this paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2021.656566/full)).  However, they are more ephemeral than shipping noise and their influence can be minimized simply by computing median values of the metric within a sufficiently long temporal bin.  A temporal bin of 1 minute is applied here to the focal metric computed at 1-second resolution.  Because the audio data have a DC offset and zeros are used to identify missing data, we also want to identify time periods of missing data using the percent of each minute having zero values.  This is important for screening values then enter into time-binned statistics."
