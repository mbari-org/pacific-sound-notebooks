**Colaboratory** is also known as Colab. It is a Google Research product that allows one to write code in a web browser.
Colab is free with limitations in compute and memory. 
Upgrading to [Colab Pro/Pro+](https://colab.research.google.com/signup) allows for more compute and memory for a fee. 
Some, but not all of these notebooks may run in the Colab environment. 

To use Colab

1. Setup a gmail account if you don't already have one.
2. Launch the notebook by clicking on one of the links below:

**Important**  - there is a 24-hour runtime limit for Colab. This can be an issue for some applications
such as training deep-learning models for sound detection and/or classification.
